# Streaming Data: Module 7 (Movie Thor)
# Name: Hajar Banyalmarjeh
    The purpose of this module is 
    to apply my knowledge and use RabbitMQ to 
    analyze some data from a CSV data file named
    ThorRangarokTwitterData which includes data for tweets that 
    were made about the movie "Thor" 


# Before You Begin
    Make sure RabbitMQ server is running
    Make sure pika is installed in your active environment


# Project explanation
    For this project, I only created a producer file, 
    and I used a lot of the coding that I have created previously 
    for module 5 & 6 and only changed a few things to allow it to 
    reflect the new CSV file I am using for this module. However, a consumer hasn't been created yet.
