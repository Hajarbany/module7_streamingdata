# Streaming Data: Module 7 (Movie Thor)
# Name: Hajar Banyalmarjeh
    The purpose of this module is to apply my knowledge and use RabbitMQ to analyze some data from a CSV data file named ThorRangarokTwitterData which includes data for tweets that were made about the movie "Thor" 


# Before You Begin
    Make sure RabbitMQ server is running
    Make sure pika is installed in your active environment


# Project explanation
    For this project, I only created a producer file, and I used a lot of the coding that I have created previously for module 5 & 6 and only changed a few things to allow it to reflect the new CSV file I am using for this module. However, a consumer hasn't been created yet.
